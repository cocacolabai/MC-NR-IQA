# MC-NR-IQA
Keras and Tensorflow implementation of Monte Carlo No-Reference Image Quality Assessment

The two experiments contained in this repo are distributed as jupyter notebooks. They correspond to the work presented in Chapter 5 of the author, Joss Whittle's, PhD Thesis.

The dataset used for the experiments MonteCarlo-IMDB is also distributed here so that the code can be run and results validated. This dataset is planned to be distributed more formally in the future with additional data and precomputed statistics.
